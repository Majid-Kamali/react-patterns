# React Patterns

A collection of commonly used and reusable React patterns based on real-world use cases.

This repository demonstrates different approaches and patterns frequently used in modern React applications, focusing on state management, data fetching, form handling, and authentication.

## Patterns Covered

1. **Context**
   - Basic state sharing using React Context API.

2. **Context + Reducer**
   - Managing complex state with `useReducer` and Context.

3. **Context + Custom Hook**
   - Abstracting Context logic into reusable custom hooks.

4. **Context + Reducer + Custom Hook**
   - A scalable pattern combining reducer-based state management with custom hooks.

5. **Redux Toolkit – createSlice**
   - State management using Redux Toolkit slices.

6. **Redux Toolkit – createApi**
   - Data fetching and caching using RTK Query.

7. **React Query**
   - Server-state management with caching, refetching, and synchronization.

8. **React Hook Form**
   - Performant and scalable form handling.

9. **Custom Hooks**
   - Reusable hooks for shared logic across components.

10. **AbortController**
    - Cancelling async requests to prevent memory leaks.

11. **Authentication & Role-Based Access**
    - Basic authentication flow with role-based authorization and protected routes.

## Goals

- Demonstrate common React patterns
- Improve code reusability and readability
- Compare different state management approaches
- Serve as a reference for learning and real projects
